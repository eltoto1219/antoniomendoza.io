                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                Hello! I am a Junior Computer Science student at UNC Chapel Hill. I have been working as a resarch assistant indepedently and jointly on research projects at the UNC NLP lab since August 2019 under Dr. Bansal.
                I remain steadfast in my pursuit of graduate school sice the start of my undergraduate career.
                <br>
                My focus, now, is to develop elegant and competive vision-language systems to expand the door of entry in VLP.
                <br>
                In some of my previous pursuits, I have collaborated with Facebook as an open source developer on their Multi-Modal Framework.
                Likewise, I have also contributed the first multi-modal model in Hugging Face's transformers library, and have implemented the functionality to support N-dimnesional data in Hugging Face's Datasets library.
                Currently, I am finishing up a framework I have developed on my own for VLP, titled: "VLTK".
                <br>
                This summer (2021), I will be working with Verisk Analytics!
