                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                Hello World! I am a Sophomore Computer Science student at UNC Chapel Hill. I am on my pursuit to make a big impact on Artifical Intelligence and Natural Language Processing as a research assistant within the UNC NLP lab under the guidance of my PI, Dr. Bansal.             

                I started programming in 2015, but my journey in AI took a serious start in 2018, when I completed <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/">CS224n</a> (Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning) online as a foundation before my research.
                <br>
                <br>
                I now work both indepedently and alongside PhD students on my research interests in which I both create ideas and designs from scratch and adapt from other published research into my own work. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I am deeply vested in my work and will be pursuing a PhD in AI and NLP once I graduate. I see the field deeply impacting humanity, and I am excited to work hard to become apart of that future.
                <br>

                <h3>Research Interests</h3>
                <p>
                For my current project, I am investigating the potential applications of 'modular learning' within NLP. Specifically, networks which are able to reason/compose an optimal/unique composition of sub-networks entailed by specific inputs. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I've also read a lot about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02762">Normalizing Flows</a> and am excitedly planning on investigating applications on non-autoregressive sentence generation for future research.
