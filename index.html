                  <h3>About Me</h3>
                  <p>I graduated from the university of Chapel Hill in 2021 while working as an undergraduate researcher to gain expertise in deep-learning. I had been guided by Prof. Mohit Bansal.</p>
                  <p>My current plan is to gain a few more years of experience as a Machine Learning engineer to subsequently apply to graduate school. After which, I hope to use my gained knowledge to create an A.I.- driven startup.</p>
                  <p>I am very passionate about AI/Ml and love to keep up to date with the literature and the most recent developments in the field.</p>
                  <!-- In some of my previous pursuits, I have collaborated with Facebook as an open source developer on their Multi-Modal Framework. -->
                  <!-- Likewise, I have also contributed the first multi-modal model in Hugging Face's transformers library, and have implemented the functionality to support N-dimnesional data in Hugging Face's Datasets library. -->
                  <!-- Currently, I am finishing up a framework I have developed on my own for VLP, titled: "VLTK". -->
                  <!-- <br> -->
                  <!-- This summer (2021), I will be working with Verisk Analytics! -->
